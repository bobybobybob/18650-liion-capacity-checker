# 18650 / LiIon capacity checker

This is based on the work from Adam Welch http://adamwelch.co.uk/2016/01/lithium-ion-18650-battery-capacity-checker/ with the following changes

- The LCD code has been removed since I'm logging to serial and recording the data via a Raspberry Pi
- Increased the cell count from 1 to 4
